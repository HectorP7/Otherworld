	<h1>Government</h1>
		<p>The government in Otherworld is really strict, the laws make it clear that citizens must work hard for their lives, and in doing so the city prospers tremendously, however most people live unhappy and stressed, which causes them to Riot often. The government does not tolerate these riots and will use force to stop them.
